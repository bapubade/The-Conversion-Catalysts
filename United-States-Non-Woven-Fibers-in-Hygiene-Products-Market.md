With an aging population and an increase in the number of people experiencing urinary incontinence, this segment is witnessing substantial growth. Non-woven fibers are integral to adult incontinence products, such as adult diapers and pads, due to their superior absorbency, comfort, and skin-friendliness. These fibers ensure that the products effectively manage moisture, maintain dryness, and reduce the likelihood of skin irritation, which is a common concern for elderly users. The demand for such products is further fueled by increased awareness of incontinence as a medical condition and the importance of maintaining personal dignity and hygiene in aging populations. In the adult incontinence products market, there is a clear trend toward developing more discreet, comfortable, and effective non-woven materials.

This evolving market continues to present opportunities for innovation and market expansion.</p> <h2>Feminine Hygiene Products</h2> <p>Feminine hygiene products, such as sanitary napkins, panty liners, and tampons, also rely heavily on non-woven fibers for their manufacture. Non-woven fabrics are used in these products for their excellent moisture-wicking, absorbent, and breathable properties, which are essential for comfort and hygiene. The fibers in feminine hygiene products are designed to ensure that moisture is rapidly absorbed and contained, providing protection and preventing leakage. Consumer preferences for high-quality, skin-friendly materials are driving the demand for non-woven fabrics in this category. Innovations in non-woven technology, including the use of organic and hypoallergenic materials, are catering to the growing awareness and concern for the materials in intimate products.
