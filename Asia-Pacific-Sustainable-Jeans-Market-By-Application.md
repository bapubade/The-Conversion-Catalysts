Consumers in the Asia Pacific region are becoming more discerning, demanding greater visibility into the production processes behind the products they buy. As a result, many sustainable jean brands are adopting transparent practices by disclosing information about their sourcing, manufacturing processes, and labor conditions. This trend is being fueled by the growing desire for ethical consumption and the need for brands to prove their sustainability claims.
